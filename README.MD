# ESP32 E-Reader Project 

## Log Levels
```ini
build_flags =
    ; ESP Log level
    -D CORE_DEBUG_LEVEL=4
```

## Supported 8 Bit BMPs
Set `lv_conf.h` parameter, in my case in `platfromio.ini`:
```ini
build_flags =
    -D LV_COLOR_DEPTH=8
```
To convert image use:

- Use Image -> Mode -> Indexed with 256 colours and dithering if needed.
- Export as a filename.bmp, the Advanced Options are greyed out.
- Depending on purpose you might need to toggle color space info on/off.

## TODO List
- [ ] Intent concept: implement action handling and intent swith with LVGL
